# Python intro 
## Why Python
### Python use cases
#### Python set up with Pycharm
##### Python Variables 

- Env Testing `print("hello world")`

```python
print("Good Morning, Please Enter your Name ")
name = input() # took user input & stored in the var called name
print("Hello dear " + name)
```
```python
# testing the env with print statement
# Dynamically typed language
# Python Variables?
# To store any data -
# To store user data - hard code the data - any other type
# first_name = "Angel" - String
# name = "Subhaan 32423423423423424324"

# UK_resident = yes or no - Boolean

# DOB = 99 - Int
# travel = 15.4 - float
# salary = 40000 Int
# gross_salary = "salary + travel"

first_name = "Shahrukh" # this is an string
last_name = "Khan"
salary = 50 # this is an int
travel = 3.5 # float

print("shahrukh")
print(first_name)
#display the value of var first_name
print(last_name)

print(salary)
print(travel)

# how to find out the type of data stored in the var
# type()
#print(type(last_name))

# interact with users by taking user data in - input()
print("Good Morning, Please Enter your Name ")
name = input() # took user input & stored in the var called name
print("Hello dear " + name)

# Get user first_name and last_name
# display the names in the line
# User DOB
# course name
# UK_resident
